Same groups as the Reg Ex presentations. Please upload your .flex file, Auto 
Generated Scanner File and input text file that you used for the tokenization 
demo as a single archive file. Look at the samples I've provided and come up 
with your own reg ex to identify and classify the sample text file you provide 
into lexemes or tokens.

Although this is a group project I want every person to turn in their own copy of the code for feedback.
